## Assignment 1: Show Bus Location
First, I apply API key through MTA website;
then I write script to read the json file and get a csv output about the bus line, active bus amounts and bus location. 

## Assignment 2: Get Bus Info
First,  I use the API key to access to the data,
then I design the script to pull the current json file and get the information about the next bus stop of specific bus line.
The script takes 3 arguments: API key, bus line and output file name.
